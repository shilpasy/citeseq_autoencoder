`install.packages('Seurat')`  
`library(Seurat)`

To run the autoencoder notebooks, you will need to have Python 3.6 or later and install Pytorch v1 and the fastai library by typing:  
`conda install -c pytorch -c fastai fastai`

To use Pip install, please first install Pytorch following the instructions on:
